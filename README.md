Treehouse Project 4 - Interactive Photo Gallery

This is my fourth project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer. 

Project notes:
- This was my 1st attempt at writing JS/jQuery and was extremely challenging. I was able to better structure my code 
  once it was suggested to me to create a single function to handle updating images in the overlay.
- Used a small plugin just for preloading of images to make the overlay run smoother on load.
- Attempted to meet Exceeds requirements as best I could:
        - Added video content from YouTube
        - Responsive, built mobile first
        - Keyboard navigation with L/R arrows
        - Wrote code for required core functionality
        - Added fade in/out effects for filtering (unsure if this counts as "animation" but within my skill level)
- Hover/scale effects added to thumbails on non-mobile sized screens
- Arrows on overlay are replaced by mobile swipe control for small device sizes (via custom jQuery Mobile file)

Needs Work or Need to Learn
- jQuery Mobile API does some weird things, I don't have a clear text button on my input anymore, for example. Need to learn more about it next time as it had some unintended effects.
- Need to learn how to adjust overlay for landscape view on mobile devices
- Would like to learn how to iterate through matched images in overlay when a search filter is active
- Was able to fade images on search but would like to learn to code sliding or other animations that plugins provide
- Need to learn strategic planning for coding. I assume this comes with experience. I would have saved time if I
  had realized ahead of time both the button navigation and the basic overlay process could utilize the same function.
  Need to practice breaking code into requirements and components instead of coding feature by feature in a linear way.

~Time to complete : HTML/CSS set up in < 2 hours, the rest of 2 weeks was spent primarily on JS coding. Using a 
lightbox plugin probably would have cut time dramatically but it was important to me to try to code it myself. Seeing examples of working similar code was most valuable for me, followed by talking though my thought process.
